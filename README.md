AIRLINE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
DESCRIPTION
INTRODUCTION:
Air travel has become less and less cheaper over the years, as a result the no: of passengers has increased considerably. Unlike a train or bus ticket where we have to stand in a queue besides a counter, air tickets are usually booked online. The proposed system is a web portal where the user can book their air travel tickets between two cities online on a particular date. There will be a provision for searching the flights for a travel destination on an input date, the search result will comprise of the full details such as flight no, flight name, cost, arrival and departure time etc. A cancellation option is also given in case user wishes to abandon his travel for various reasons.
ADVANTAGES:-
Easy to book tickets.
Saves time and money.
Provides every information about flight.
24/7 customer support through chat and calls.
Mobile Availability.
Send automated tickets to the customer by mail.
Easy Refund Policies.
Available for both Domestic and International Airlines.

DISADVANTAGES:-
WE DON’T HAVE A DATABASE .
